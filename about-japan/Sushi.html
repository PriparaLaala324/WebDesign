    <p class="sub-heading">Do you know that sushi isn't originally from Japan?</p>
    <p id="sentence">The history of sushi dates back to 2000 years ago when Japan began to develop rice cultivation.</p>
    <p id="sentence">The prototype of sushi appeared in the Yayoi period, when people invented the practice of fermenting edible fish with salt in rice, which is today's cooked sushi. At this time, rice was used for fermentation and was not eaten.</p>
    <p id="sentence">The style of sushi as it is known today took shape around the 8th century.</p>
    <p id="sentence">People use traditional methods to let the rice ferment naturally under the action of lactic acid bacteria, and then marinate the fish and wrap it in it.</p>
